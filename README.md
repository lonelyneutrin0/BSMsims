This is a passion project to learn more about ROOT, MadGraph and BSM (Beyond-Standard-Model) Particle Simulations. Through this project, I hope to learn about
- Supersymmetry (SUSY) Production
- Graviton Production
- Dark Matter (DM) Direct Detection
- Higgs Portal Models
- Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs)
- Composite Higgs Models
- Axion and Axion-Like Particles (ALPs)
- Leptoquarks
- New Gauge Bosons
- Invisible Higgs Decays
- Majorana Neutrinos and the Seesaw Mechanism
